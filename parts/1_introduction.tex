\chapter{Introduction}

The Semantic Web is getting more and more popular and with it the need for ways to publish Linked (Open) Data. In order to cover these needs, a lot of different tools, frameworks and solutions came up, some covering the whole process of publishing L(O)D, others covering only steps in the process of it. These led to a vast diversity but also a big number of options. In order to develop a LOD project, the responsible stakeholders now have to choose among these many options.

\section{Research Question}

Aim of this paper is to compare existing and common LOD solutions to give responsible stakeholders at TU Wien a decision guidance for choosing one. The concrete research question is as following:

\textbf{RQ:} \textit{How do common LOD solutions~\footnotemark compare against each?}
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{RQ1:} What are existing LOD solutions?
\item \textbf{RQ2:} What are criteria to compare solutions?
\item \textbf{RQ3:} How do they compare against each other?
\item \textbf{RQ4:} What can be a solution for TU Wien?
\end{enumerate}

The conducted work is a follow-up work of a previous study (see ~\cite{baronyai_publishing_2016}) done by the author and will build up on it.

\footnotetext{\textbf{Note}: The term \textit{solutions} is used here on purpose to abstract terms like \textit{framework}, \textit{tool} or \textit{all-in-one solution}. Using only the term \textit{framework} would lead to problems and cut out other options. For a more detailed discussion see section~\ref{def:framework}}.

\section{Methodology}

The work was done as a literature study. First a discussion of the term "framework" was done in order to achieve the research question. Then a range of existing L(O)D projects and application was investigated, to extract used technologies from them. From this, candidates were retrieved and classified. After excluding and filtering some of the candidates, they were compared in four criteria groups: Criteria from the above mentioned study, usability, data formats and the Linked Data Publishing Checklist.

\section{Structure of this Paper}
This paper starts with a state of the art section in which similar comparision will be described. The next chapter~\ref{chap:methodology} is the definition of the used methodology, where a discussion of the term "framework" will be done for this paper (section~\ref{def:framework}), the process of the literature study (section~\ref{meth_study}) and the classification (section~\ref{classification}) system will be defined.

In chapter~\ref{overview} the found solution will be reviewed and described as well as the excluded candidates (section~\ref{excluded}). In chapter~\ref{criteria} the criteria as well as their according scala will be defined. The final comparison will be done in chapter~\ref{comparison}, the summary of it can be found in section~\ref{comp_summary}.

The last research question, RQ4, will be answered in chapter~\ref{ch:tuwien}, investigating, which of the proposed solutions may be suitable for which situation at TU Wien.

The last chapter, \ref{ch:summary}, describes the overall summary and future work.
